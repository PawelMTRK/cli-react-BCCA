# BCCA - Barebones Console Cellular Automata

## Intro

A really barebones and probably silly 1D cellular automata.

It was never meant to be efficient, it's purpose was to test how
React works when creating consoles applications.

However, it may someday be updated and refined, the front end will still
not be as efficient as some of the other cellular automatas out there.

 - ![Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) - a really neat, single binary JS runtime
 - ![Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) - quite interesting take on creating
 console apps. Should definitely experiment with it more.
